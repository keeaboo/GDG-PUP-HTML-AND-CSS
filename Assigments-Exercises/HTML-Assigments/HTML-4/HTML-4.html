            <li>Paper</li>
            <li>Eraser</li>
        </ul>
    <h2>Steps to Get Started</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Gather all materials</li>
            <li>While lightly holding your pen, quickly draw a circle on the paper. Repeat until the whole paper is filled with circles</li>
            <li>Now practice with quick lines, horizontal, diagonal, vertical, angular lines. You can also try shapes like triangles, squares. Try holding your pencil lightly, the paper should not have visible indents.</li>
