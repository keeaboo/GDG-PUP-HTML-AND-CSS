    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>Hi! I'm Mhykee, a web developer cadet. I am 18 years old from Malabon City and currently a freshman at PUP Main. A very introverted person.</p>
    <h2>Hobbies</h2>
    <p>I watch Kdramas and Animes everytime I get bored. I also love to draw and sing even though I may not be good at them. I also play games like valorant, honkai star rail, sky cotl, but only if I have plenty of free time. I want to add travelling but I don't get to travel a lot. I also like to listen to music, mostly jpop, piano, and game or film music.</p>
